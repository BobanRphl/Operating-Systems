# Operating-Systems

This repository shows my in-class coding assignments on basic concepts in Operating Systems.

The first branch shows basic concepts in forking and returning from processes.

The second branch shows an implementation of a multi-threaded producer and consumer function.

The third branch shows an implementation of processor scheduling algorithms.
