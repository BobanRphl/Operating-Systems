The main file (main.c) accepts buffer size, number of producers and number of consumers as command line arguments and invokes the producer and consumer processes.

The file 'prod_cons.c' contains the producer and consumer functions which are invoked by the main program.

/*****To compile the main.c and prod_cons.c'*****/

1. On linux bash navigate to the directory 'project1'
2. Type make. 
   This will create an executable by the name of make.




/******To run the program*******/

 Type ./make <buffer_size> <number of producers> <number of consumers>
